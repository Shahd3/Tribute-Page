         <p id="text-3"> Sheikh Zayed was born in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1918 at Qasr al-Hosn to Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1922-1926. He was the youngest of Sheikh Sultan’s four sons and was named after his famous grandfather, known as ‘Zayed the Great’, the Ruler of the Emirate from 1885-1909.
Sheikh Zayed had a strong passion for anything with which a trueborn Arab is identified such as falconry, riding Arabian thoroughbred camel and horses and mastering archery. His character was shaped in his early youth, while living in the city of Al Ain. Its calm and vast expanses were instrumental in developing his leadership qualities.</p>
<h2 id="subtitle-2">As the Ruler’s Representative in the Eastern Region:</h2><br> 

<p id="text-4">In 1946, Sheikh Zayed was appointed as representative of his brother, Sheikh Shakhbut Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, in the Eastern Region. During his twenty years as his brother’s representative, Sheikh Zayed gained a reputation as a natural born leader who ruled by example. Sheikh Zayed became not only a well-known, but also a popular and respected leader who was eager to listen to all his subjects and whose decisions were based on the consensus of the various tribes in the region. He frequently travelled to even the remotest parts of the region in order to consult with people regarding their needs. He kept an open majlis, maintained close ties with his people and personally oversaw the implementation of reforms. He was the paragon of generosity and hospitality.
Sir Wilfred Thesiger, the famous British traveler who documented his famous trips across the Empty Quarter, noted in his book ‘Arabian Sands’ that Sheikh Zayed was “a strongly-built man, with a brown beard. He was shrewd and sharp-witted, and his manner was quiet but masterful”.  Thesiger remarked that Sheikh Zayed was a man whom he looked forward to meeting as “He had a great reputation among the Bedouins. They liked him for his easy, informal ways and his friendliness, and they respected his strong character, his shrewdness and his physical strength. They said admiringly ‘Zayed is a Bedouin. He knows a lot about camels, can ride them like us, is a sharpshooter and a skillful fight’.”
